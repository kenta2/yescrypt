.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
This manual page documents briefly the  
\fBCurveCP\fR commands. 
.PP 
A traditional UNIX-style server such as ftpd handles just  
one network connection, reading input from stdin and writing output 
to stdout. A "superserver" such as inetd or tcpserver listens for  
network connections and starts a separate server process for  
each connection. 
.PP 
\fBcurvecpprintkey\fR prints ascii version of binary 
keys needed for \fBcurvecpclient\fR  and \fBcurvecpserver\fR and created using  
\fBcurvecpmakekey\fR command before. 
.SH "OPTIONS"

How to use \fBcurvecpprintkey\fR:
